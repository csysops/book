- nature Neumann arch: computer divided to `cpu` and `memory`

# Structure of Computer Memory
- `memory`: fixed-size storage locations storing only number
- (program’s data == data) on `memory`: stored and accessed the same way
# CPU
- cpu read instruction from memory one at time and execute them called fetch-execute cycle
-   cpu get next instruction from address holding by program counter and pass to instruction decoder,
- it extract instruction meaning and data addresses belong to the process, then CPU send signals to for processing to general-purpose registers from memory then pass the data and operand to ALU and return to either memory or register.
