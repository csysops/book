- nature Neumann arch: computer divided to `cpu` and `memory`

# Structure of Computer Memory
- `memory`: fixed-size storage locations storing only number
- (program’s data == data) on `memory`: stored and accessed the same way
# CPU
- cpu read instruction from memory one at time and execute them called `fetch-execute cycle`
- mechanism:
  - cpu load next instruction from address holding by `program counter`
  - then pass to `instruction decoder`, it extract instruction meaning && data addresses that belong to the process
  - then cpu send signals to load all of the data it needs from `memory` to `general-purpose registers` for processing
  - then pass the `data` and `operand` to `ALU`
  - then return to either memory or register
  - load/store memory operation is done through `data bus` bridge
